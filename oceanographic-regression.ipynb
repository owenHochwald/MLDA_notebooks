Importance Normalization, and Standardization in Linear Regression\n","\n","\n","### Normalization\n","Normalization is the process of scaling data to fit within a specific range, typically [0, 1]. This is crucial for linear regression because it ensures that all features contribute equally to the model. Without normalization, features with larger ranges could dominate the regression model and skew the results. Min-max scaling is a common normalization technique.\n","\n","### Standardization\n","Standardization scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This process is essential for linear regression because it ensures that the model's weights are on a comparable scale, which can lead to more stable and faster convergence during training. Standardization is typically performed using z-score
